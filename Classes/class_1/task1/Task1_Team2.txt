Bed Head -Manchester Orchestra

Arguing with the dead
I'm not alone but it sure feels like someone left
Deaf notes and talking heads
Carrying on your debt
Blood on the bed head and volumes you left unsaid
Let 'em talk and let it habit, now I'm afraid you're alone
Oh my God
Let me relinquish and start to distinguish my past, and my time
You and I are oil and fire, so
Oh my God
Let me extinguish the habit, the sequence, the loss, in my mind
Now I believe in the ghost
Ghost
Crawling against your skin
Clutching my neck said "it's all supposed to end like this"
You and I are panoramic
Now I'm afraid of the ghost
Oh my God
Let me relinquish and start to distinguish my past, and my time
There is only love and fire, so
Oh my God
Let me extinguish the habit, the sequence, the loss, in my mind
Now I believe in the-
Right by the entrance, you broke
Finally, reality's taking its hold
You're not who you were, but you can't let it go
You're not where you're from, but you're always alone
So I stick a flag in the ground
I think I know who I'm living for now
I am what I am, same above as the ground
It's not what I want, but I'm figuring it out
Oh my God
Let me relinquish and start to distinguish my past, and my time
You and I are holy fire, so
Oh my God
Let me extinguish the habit, the sequence, the loss, in my mind
Now I believe in the ghost
Ghost
Gho-
Ghost
He was teasing around the town and cried "wolf, wolf"
Everybody came to help, but there was no wolf

Selfless - The Strokes
Can the dark side light my way out? Yeah
Lay your hand across my face, yeah
Time we lost, that's all my fault

Please don't be long
'Cause I want your love
I don't have love
Without your arm
Life is too short
But I will live for you

How did this fit in your story? Yeah
Why'd you let them judge your body? Yeah
I'll be waiting there outside, yeah

Please don't be long
'Cause I want your arms
I don't have fun
Without your love
Life is too short
But I will live for you
You're backing off
But I will live for you my selfless love

I bite my tongue, I wait my turn
I waited for a century
Waste my breath, no lessons learned
I turn and face the enemy

I'm not scared, just don't care
I'm not listening, you hear?
He's never there, I don't care
I can't tell you what and where
Yeah, yeah
