-Rodrigo Quevedo

I saw you lookin' for the side door
You didn't wanna stick around for
The rest of the night
I guess that's alright
They all left when you walked home
It makes sense that they all know
It was only for you
If only you knew
What good is love
Without any strings?
Held it above
Stuck in between
Tell me for once
What that even means
I wanna know you
But can't make it right
There's something on my mind
There's something that I
Wish I would've told you but you just don't seem
To wonder what I'm doin' when you're close to me
Oh, yeah
There's something on my chest
I wish I would've said
I think it over and it might be true
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
We locked eyes from a distance
So close but I missed it
Now you're walking away
When I wish you would stay
I get stuck in a conversation
A different night, same situation
I beat myself up
For not speakin' up
Every night, I can't make it right, yeah
There's something on my mind
There's something that I
Wish I would've told you but you just don't seem
To wonder what I'm doin' when you're close to me
Oh, yeah
There's something on my chest
I wish I would've said
I think it over and it might be true
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
Only overthinking when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
Oh, yeah
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
Oh, yeah

Leave The Door Open (feat. Anderson .Paak)
Said baby, said baby, said baby

What you doin'? (What you doin'?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
Don't say that (shut your trap)
I'm sippin' wine (sip, sip) in a robe (drip, drip)
I look too good (look too good)
To be alone (woo, woo)
My house clean (house clean), my pool warm (pool warm)
Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you’re coming through

You're so sweet (so sweet), so tight (so tight)
I won't bite (ah-ah), unless you like (unless you like)
If you smoke (what you smoke?) I got the haze (purple haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (woo)
Oh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be making (shamone!)
I'm talking kissing, cuddling
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you’re coming through (oh, girl)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I need you, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I gotta see you, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (girl, I'm tryna give you this, ah)

Hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
And I'm hopin', hopin'
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you’re coming through (woo!)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (tell me)
Tell me that you're coming through
(Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo)
(Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
Tell me that you're coming through
Girl, I'm here just waiting for you (oh!)
Come on over, I'll adore you (I gotta know!)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I'm waiting, waiting, waiting)
Tell me that you're coming through (for you)
Girl, I'm here just waiting for you
Come on over, I'll adore you
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

First things first
I'm going to say all the words
Inside my head
I'm fired up and tired
Of the way that things have been
The way that things have been
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea
The master of my sea

I was broken from a young age
Taken my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look to me, took to me
Shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life my love my drive it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove
Your spirit up above
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived
Ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life my love my drive it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins
The blood in my veins
But they never did, ever lived
Ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life my love my drive it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
